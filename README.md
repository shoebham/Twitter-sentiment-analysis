# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
<h2>Twitter sentiment analysis bot created while following sentdex nltk tutorial on youtube. It runs sentiment analysis on live twitter feed.</h2>
<h3>The model is not accurate and was trained on only adjectives hence you can fool it easily (see sentiment_analysis file, the first sentence returns negative). </h3>
Installation and Execution:
<ul>
<li>Install tweepy from pip</li>
<li>Install nltk from pip</li>
<li>Create api keys from dev.twitter.com</li>
<li>Run the text_classification file and store the trained models</li>
<li>Run the sentiment_mod to load the models</li>
<li>Or directly run the twitter_sentiment_analysis file which will show you live twitter feed with its analysis in the end</li>
</ul>
